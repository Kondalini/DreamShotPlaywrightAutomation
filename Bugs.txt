Title: Issue with automatic email filling and inactive Sign-Up button
Severity: High
Priority: High
Reported By: Alex Krastev
Date Reported: 21.11.2024
Environment: Browser Edge

Description:
After entering the email in the "Email" field during the sign-up process, the email field is automatically populated with the email address again, instead of allowing the user to fill in a password manually. Additionally, after clicking the "Sign Up" button, the confirmation popup appears, but it remains inactive and does not provide any feedback or further action.

Steps to Reproduce:
Go to the Sign Up page.
Fill in the Email field with "alex_kr@abv.bg".
Notice that the Password field is automatically filled with the email instead of allowing the user to manually input a password.
Enter the Password as "password123".
Click on the Sign Up button.
Observe that the confirmation popup appears but remains inactive.
Expected Behavior:
The Email field should only be filled once, and the Password field should remain empty for the user to fill.
Clicking the Sign Up button should trigger a confirmation message or successful registration process.
The confirmation popup should be interactive, allowing the user to proceed.
Actual Behavior:
The Email field is automatically filled with the email address again, overriding the user's input.
After clicking the Sign Up button, the confirmation popup appears but remains inactive.
